# Description
This program calculates the sum of all integers in an array.
It demonstrates a straightforward approach to iterating over a list and accumulating values.
# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers ar, compute the sum of its elements and return the result.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11]
