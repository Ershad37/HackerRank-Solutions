# Description
This program determines the index of a character that can be removed to make a given string a palindrome.
If the string is already a palindrome or cannot be made into one by removing a single character, it returns -1.
# Problem Statement
Given a string s, find the index of a character to remove to make s a palindrome.
If s is already a palindrome, return -1.
If no single character removal can make s a palindrome, return -1.
If multiple solutions exist, return the lowest index.
Example:
Input: "aaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Removing the character at index 3 ('b') results in "aaa", which is a palindrome.
